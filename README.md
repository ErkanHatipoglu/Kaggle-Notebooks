# Kaggle-Notebooks

This repository is for my public notebooks on Kaggle. The explanation for each notebook is below:

### 1 - getting-started-with-titanic.ipynb

This is my first notebook on Kaggle. I was a newbie, and the notebook had so many mistakes. I keep it since it is my first notebook. 

### 2 - intermediate-machine-learning-course-helper

This notebook is inspired by [Intermediate Machine Learning (IML)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) Course by [Alexis Cook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook) at [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview).

It includes solutions for handling missing values, dealing with categorical variables, using Scikit-learn library pipelines, cross-validation and XGBoost on **Ames Housing dataset**.
