# Kaggle-Notebooks

This repository is for my public notebooks on Kaggle. The explanation for each notebook is below:

### 1 - getting-started-with-titanic.ipynb

This is my first notebook on Kaggle. I was a newbie, and the notebook had so many mistakes. I keep it since it is my first notebook. 

Data &rarr; [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

### 2 - intermediate-machine-learning-course-helper.ipynb

This notebook is inspired by [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) Course by [Alexis Cook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook) at [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview).

It includes solutions for handling missing values, dealing with categorical variables, using Scikit-learn library pipelines, cross-validation and XGBoost on **Ames Housing dataset**.

### 3 - housing-prices-pipeline-starter-code.ipynb

This is a Scikit-learn pipeline tutorial on **Ames Housing dataset**. It includes preprocessing, validation, cross-validation, prediction, saving, and submission to the competition steps.

### 4 - introduction-to-sklearn-pipelines-with-titanic.ipynb 

A comprehensive tutorial about Scikit-learn library pipelines. The notebook includes:

* Pipelines,
* Estimators,
* fit and transform mechanism,
* Custom Transformers,
* Column Transformers,
* Feature Unions,
* Implementing a Scikit-learn pipeline from start to end with tabular data.

### 6 - titanic-on-function-transformers-and-pipelines.ipynb

A tutorial on using function transformers with Scikit-learn library pipelines.

Data &rarr; [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

### 7 - heart-failure-prediction-with-xgboost.ipynb

This is a notebook for predicting cardiovascular death events using [Heart failure clinical records](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).

The notebook includes:
* Scikit-learn library Pipelines,
* Validation with early_stopping_rounds,
* Grid Search,
* Cross-validation,
* confusion matrix,
* accuracy, precision, recall, f1_score from scratch.

### 8 - house-prices-using-pipelines.ipynb

This is a notebook similar to housing-prices-pipeline-starter-code.ipynb (#3). It is submitted to the GettingStarted Prediction Competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

Data &rarr; [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

### 9 - univariate-linear-regression-from-scratch.ipynb

This tutorial notebook explains basic machine learning concepts such as univariate linear regression, the hypothesis, the cost function, and gradient descent.

Data &rarr; [Linear Regression](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andonians/random-linear-regression)

### 10 - multivariate-linear-regression-from-scratch.ipynb

This tutorial notebook explains how to implement the hypothesis, cost function, and gradient descent algorithms in Python with a vectorization method for a multivariate Linear Regression task.
