By forking the notebook, the reader may quickly try different approaches and concepts (EDA, Feature Engineering, other models, etc.). I have tried to keep this notebook as basic as possible.\n","\n","Sklearn has several functions to calculate and display accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores. However, I will not use those functions and will calculate those results manually for demonstration purposes. \n","\n","We need to increase the recall score for this dataset task since we do not want to misclassify heart failure cases. In other words, we want the number of true positives to be as high as possible while the number of false negatives is as small as possible. It is better to falsely treat a patient than to leave another patient to die because of misclassification.\n","\n","It seems that the time column needs to be dropped since it is not a predictor. It turns out that we cannot get a time value for new patients after deployment.
