Approximately all the code in this notebook is taken from Intermediate Machine Learning Course notebooks. On the other hand, all the mistakes (if any) are made by me.\n","\n","This notebook is neither an alternative nor a complementary work for Intermediate Machine Learning Course. I strongly suggest to the Kaggle Learn users to take the Course and solve the exercise notebooks by themself. However, I observed that students got stuck on some parts of the Course from time to time. This notebook is intended for those students who get stuck and cannot move forward.\n","\n","Intermediate Machine Learning consists of 7 chapters. In some chapters, students use the data from [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course) to learn new approaches; they even make submissions for that competition. You can find those different approaches below. You can also see how to submit your predictions using those approaches to [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).\n","\n","If you face any problems or cannot implement the code, just let me know via the comments. I will try to answer as soon as possible.
