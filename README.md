# Kaggle-Notebooks

This repository is for my public notebooks on Kaggle. The explanation for each notebook is below:

### 1 - getting-started-with-titanic.ipynb

This is my first notebook on Kaggle. I was a newbie, and the notebook had so many mistakes. I keep it since it is my first notebook. 

### 2 - intermediate-machine-learning-course-helper.ipynb

This notebook is inspired by [Intermediate Machine Learning (IML)](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) Course by [Alexis Cook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook) at [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview).

It includes solutions for handling missing values, dealing with categorical variables, using Scikit-learn library pipelines, cross-validation and XGBoost on **Ames Housing dataset**.

### 3 - housing-prices-pipeline-starter-code.ipynb

This is a Scikit-learn pipeline tutorial on **Ames Housing dataset**. It includes preprocessing, validation, cross-validation, prediction, saving, and submission to the competition steps. 

### 4 - introduction-to-sklearn-pipelines-with-titanic.ipynb 

A comprehensive tutorial about Scikit-learn library pipelines. The notebook includes:

* Pipelines,
* Estimators,
* fit and transform mechanism,
* Custom Transformers,
* Column Transformers,
* Feature Unions,
* Implementing a Scikit-learn pipeline from start to end with tabular data.

### 5 - housing-prices-gridsearchcv-example.ipynb

A tutorial on using GridSearchCV with Scikit-learn library pipelines. It is forked from the housing-prices-pipeline-starter-code.ipynb and GridSearchCV part is added. 

### 6 - titanic-on-function-transformers-and-pipelines.ipynb

A tutorial on using function transformers with Scikit-learn library pipelines.
