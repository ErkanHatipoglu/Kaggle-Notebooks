    "# Introduction  <a id='introduction'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains Python code for a multivariate linear regression task. Multivariate linear regression means linear regression with more than one variable. In addition to Python, we will also use Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my [Univariate Linear Regression from Scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/code/erkanhatipoglu/univariate-linear-regression-from-scratch) notebook, we have already seen basic Machine Learning concepts such as the hypothesis, cost function, and gradient descent. We will not explain those concepts in this notebook. Anyone interested may refer to my Kaggle notebook [Univariate Linear Regression from Scratch](https://www.kaggle.com/code/erkanhatipoglu/univariate-linear-regression-from-scratch) or my Medium blog post [Univariate Linear Regression from Scratch](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/univariate-linear-regression-from-scratch-68065fe8eb09) published in [Towards AI](https://pub.towardsai.net/) for a more detailed explanation. We will use a gradient descent solution and not discuss the 'normal equation.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is greatly inspired by the famous Machine Learning course by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/). All the mistakes, if any, are made by me.\n",
